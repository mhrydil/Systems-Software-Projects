## Project 1 - A .png file tool
- This project allows the user to perform various tasks on .png files like:
	- read the PNG file format and show all the chunks
	- extract basic information about the file and display it
	- extract textual information from the file and display it

## Project 2 - Memory Allocator
- This project is a basic memory allocator that mimics the functionality of malloc and free
	- Worst-Fit Allocation Algorithm used
	- Coalesces neighboring blocks if they are free when freeing
	- Splits blocks if they are larger than requested to limit internal fragmentation
